        <h2> Land Animals </h2>

        <p> Terrestrial animals are animals that live predominantly or entirely on land (e.g., cats, ants, spiders), as compared with aquatic animals, which live predominantly or entirely in the water (e.g., fish, lobsters, octopuses), or amphibians, which
            rely on a combination of aquatic and terrestrial habitats (e.g., frogs, or newts).</p>

        <h2>Characteristics of terristial animals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The terrestial animals have legs </li>
            <li>They have well developed sense organs.</li>
            <li>They have good adaptations</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The heaviest land mammal is the African bush elephant which has a weight of up to 5.4 tonnes. This enormous mammal measures 10-13 ft at the shoulder and consumes around 230 kilograms of vegetation a day. The elephant possesses a set of tusks that
            grow continuously throughout its life. These tusks have the potential to reach 2.7 m in length, although they are most commonly recorded at a length of 0.6â€“0.9 metres. The average walking speed of an elephant is 7.2 km/h.</h3>

    <h4 align="centre"> Aerial Animals </h4>
    <p align="centre"> A number of animals have evolved aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) have evolved separately many times, without any single ancestor. Flight has evolved at least four times, in the
        insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. </p>

    <h2> Aquatic Animals
        <h2>
            <i> An aquatic animal is an animal, either vertebrate or invertebrate, which lives in the water for most or all of its lifetime. Many insects such as mosquitoes, mayflies, dragonflies and caddisflies have aquatic larvae, with winged adults. </i>
            <h3>Aquatic animals may breathe air or extract oxygen that dissolved in water through specialised organs called gills, or directly through the skin.</h3>
